I chose a study from Dataverse
"Comparing apples to apples: an environmental criminology analysis of the effects of heat and rain on violent crimes in Boston."
[study link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/4UZ9D4/OAQXSM&version=1.0)

* The quality of the information is high. 
  1. The information was findable since a download link was included for the data on the site which could be easily located from looking up the study on the Dataverse site.
  2. The information was accessible because it was published on the public Dataverse site.
  3. The information was interoperable because several different formats of the data were available for download (.csv, tab-delimited, etc.).
  4. The information was reusable because metadata files were provided for the data and furthermore, the study itself was a replication of a previous study.
* The provenance of the data was that it was a replication of a previous study published in a Palgrave Communications article bearing the same title (without the Replication Data for part). The data was collected using orginal data from the following sites:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web ; https://data.cityofboston.gov.
* The hypotheses of the project are that heat and rain would increase violent crimes in Boston and LA.
* The research methods used in the study were replicating a previously-conducted study, and the basic scientific method. The researchers relied on government data and city data to collect their obeservations (i.e. they did not collect data themselves).
* I could not find the license information for the data on the dataverse site. However, after reading general Dataverse guidelines, I know that this dataset is governed by the Dataverse licensing that is in place since the data publishers did not create a custom license.
* Yes, I can open the project files, including the actual dataset and the metadata for it.
