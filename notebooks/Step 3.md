**Hypothesis testing:**

HA: The presence of precipitation decreases the daily violent crime count in Boston.

H0: Precipitation has no effect on the daily violent crime count in Boston. 

According to these hypotheses, the treatment group for our experiment includes all days when there was precipitation (i.e. PRCP > 1) and the control group includes all days when there was no precipitation (i.e. PRCP = 0).

The variables we will analyze include crime levels, heat index, wind and heat index, PRCP values, snow levels, wind levels, seasons (winter and spring), and events.

The test statistic used in the original analysis was average exposure effect. For our test we used the average crime rate for rainy days and non rainy days to see if we would reject or keep the null. 

Crime rates were counted for days where there was rain and days where there was no rain. Overall it was found through exploratory data visualizations that more crimes occurred on days when it rained. The average crime rate for rainy days was 230 whereas the average crime rate for non rainy days was 239. 

Additionally a negative confidence interval for the AEE allowed us to reject the null hypothesis.
