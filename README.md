This project for L&S 88 attempts to recreate the analysis in a replication of a study originally published in Nature titled: Comparing apples to apples. The purpose of this project is to attempt to reproduce the findings in the original analysis regarding the relationship between heat and rain and violent crimes in LA. We will also evaluate the efficacy and reliability of this data set to qualify any conclusions that we draw. For more detailed information, see our [Pre-Analysis Plan](notebooks/pre-analysis-plan.ipynb).
