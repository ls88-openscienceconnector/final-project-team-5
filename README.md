This project for L&S 88 attempts to recreate the analysis in a study originally published in Palgrave Communications titled [Comparing Apples to Apples](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0188-3#Tab1). The purpose of this project is to attempt to reproduce the findings in the original analysis regarding the relationship between heat and rain and violent crimes in Boston. We will also evaluate the efficacy and reliability of the methods in the original study to qualify any conclusions that we draw. For more detailed information, see our [Pre-Analysis Plan](notebooks/pre-analysis-plan.ipynb).
